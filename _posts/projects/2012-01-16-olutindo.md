<p>On December 12, 2011, Kayunga District in Uganda launched a new customer service that enables citizens to notify 
District officials of concerns with public services in health, education, or public works through SMS text messaging. 
Citizens can send an SMS with their location (village, clinic, school) and problem or message to 7333. 
This will create a &quot;trouble ticket&quot; which will be routed to a district health, education, or public works official.  
The district official will acknowledge the ticket and send updates to the original sender as the problem is resolved.</p>

<p>Each district health, education, and public works official is equipped with a small 3G tablet that will enable communications 
about a problem even when away from the office. The tablet software has been developed using <a href="/coconut">Coconut</a>. 
When the software is running on the tablet, the main screen displays a searchable listing of incoming trouble tickets:</p>

<p>Clicking the link to the record opens a view of the citizen's request:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rti.org">RTI </a>initiated this pilot project with the cooperation of the Kayunga District Chairperson and 
designed the software, which is open source.
